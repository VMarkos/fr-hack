### About Marine Heatwaves

**Marine Heatwave (MHW):** Episodes of exceptionally high ocean temperatures that persist for a long period / long periods of time (they are typically statistically rare). They are observed both on coastal areas and open seas.

Some important surface MHWs include:

1. 1999, Ligurian sea / Marseilles, 2 - 3 C increment.
2. 2003, covering 46% - 70% of the basin, 2 - 7 C local increment, duration of 48 - ~100 days (!).
3. 2007, June, Agean sea, ~3 C increment.
4. 2013, Eastern Med Sea, ~1 C increment.
5. 2015, July - August, Southeast of Spain, 2 C increment, 6 weeks, affected also ~89% of the basin.
6. 2017, Summer, NW Med Sea, 6 months,  top 6 C increment.
7. 2018, Summer, Gulf of Lion, Cyprus, Crete (affecting the entire Basin).
8. 2019, June - December, W Med Sea, 6 MHWs, 1,8 - 5,3 C increment, 5 to 20 days.
9. 2019, Summer, E Med Sea, 2 events, 21 and 159 days.
10. 2020, Summer, E Med Sea, >6 C increment.
11. 2020, Winter, Spring, Summer, W Med Sea, ~2 C increment, max 80 days.
11. 2021, Summer, Aegean sea, > 31 C max sea temperature, >20 days.
12. 2022-3, NW Med Sea, 2,6 C average and 4,3 C max daily anomalies.

In a nutshell, a (surface) MHW could be classified as an (upwards) anomaly in the surface sea temperature over the course of a few days, typically more than a week or so.

**Key reason** for surface MHWs appears to be the long term SST warming trend observed in the recent decades (1982+).

There are also subsurface MHWs, which are most intensely observed at 55m depth, most probably due to the longest heat preservation at deeper sea levels. Such MHWs are more frequent in the last decades (1982+), while, notably, some subsurface events might not have a directly observable impact on the surface level.

### About The Problem

Maybe useful for a presentation:

1. Annual Sea Surface Temperature (SST) increment rate ~0,034 - 0,041 Celsius / year vs global trend of 0,0015 C / y.
2. Largest warming trend in the Aegean and Levantine seas (0,05 C / y).
3. Similarly, on the west in the Balearic, Tyrrhenian and Adriatic seas.
4. ...
